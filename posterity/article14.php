      <h2>All About Armor</h2>
      <p>Authors: Aceflyer, Bomook, Dr Brain</p>
      <div class="tut">
        <p>A quick perusal of the ?buy armor menu shows one a staggering array of different Armors available for purchase and use. How can one select an optimal Armor for a particular ship setup without wasting tons of Hyperspace money buying and trying them all out, or investing a significant amount of time and brainpower trying to understand the ?iteminfo entries of each Armor? Easy! Just read this All About Armor guide, and you'll be able to choose your best Armor in a whiz! Oh, and by the way, rest assured... all Armors are 'forever' items, meaning they'll stay on your ship 'forever' (i.e. until you sell it). Finally, keep in mind... not all Armors actually 'protect' you... there are Armors that just make you faster and more maneuverable, and some Armors even increase the amount of damage you take from certain weapons. So read carefully! And have fun!</p>
        <p>For more information about what parameters like "bullet damage" (bulletdamage), "bullet damage upgrade" (bulletdamageup), and "inactive shrap damage" (inactshrapdamage) mean, please refer to Information: Iteminfo and Shipstatus.</p>
