      <h1>Legacy Articles</h1>
      <p>The following list of articles was preserved from the original Hyperspace website, which ceased to be live some time in 2013 (regular updates stopped around 2009). This information may still be helpful to players of the current Hyperspace zone, however, because of the zone's constantly evolving nature, this information may be outdated. In the case of inaccurate information, these articles are preserved here for strategic nostalgia purposes.</p>
      <p>In many instances one or more resources, such as images, included with the original articles has been lost, and can not be included in these reproductions. In the case of images which were included on the article page (as an image), a note has been added to the article. In the case where an image was accessible through a link, these links have been omitted to avoid confusion.</p>
