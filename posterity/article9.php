        <p>Basing. Bountying. Centering. Flagging. In addition to these fun activities in the zone, in order to better serve you, the Hyperspace staff bring you.... <b>Special Events</b>!</p>
        <p>Special Events are typically hosted by online staff when they feel that hosting such an event is appropriate. Special Events are generally prized, with the winners being rewarded with Hyperspace money ($100 - $10000) or a <a href="article7.php">'one time use' item</a>, depending on the event. Here is a brief guide to the types of events currently being hosted by Hyperspace staff.</p>
        <p>- image lost to the ether ("SSCE Hyperspace Special Events") -</p>
        <p><b>AutoTurret Survival</b>: A classic game of survival. Unkillable autoturrets (a bit like the Point Defense turrets, but more Uber!) and participating players are placed in a small confined box. The autoturrets then automatically spam bombs at any nearby ships. The last surviving player in the box gets rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>

        <p><b>Baserace</b>: This is a variant of the Racing event where participants race through the corridors of many connected bases in the specially designed Baserace arena. The fastest players to reach the Finish box get rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Hyperspace staff</i></p>
        <p><b>Bombline</b>: The fun Super Bombline event involves one or more players being selected to bomb, and the other players being placed in identical Warbirds without any weapons or powerups. The bombers are placed in Leviathans and, depending on the map being used for a particular Bombline event, either fire bombs or Thors at the other players. The last surviving Warbird player gets rewarded with Hyperspace money. If there is no single surviving Warbird player, the bombers get rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>

        <p><b>Bombsquare</b>: New event taking place in the Bombsquare arena coming soon!</p>
        <p><b>Elim</b>: The classic Continuum Elimination event, but with a Hyperspace flair! Players get to choose their ship and buy systems of their choice to equip their ships. Then it's an all-out free-for-all where everyone is on their own. Players are eliminated when they have died five times. The players with the most kills, and the last surviving players, get rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>

        <p><b>FastFingers</b>: The FastFingers event involves a staff member arena messaging a string of characters. The first player to <u>correctly</u> reproduce the string of characters in public chat gets rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Aceflyer, Sass, Sharpflame</i></p>
        <p><b>General Trivia</b>: This simple but enjoyable event involves a staff member asking general trivia questions via arena messages. For each question, the first player to reply with the correct answer gets rewarded with Hyperspace money or a 'one time use' item.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Aceflyer, Sass, Sharpflame, Swift Warrior</i></p>
        <p><b>Hunt That Turret</b>: Sometimes a really Uber, "mega-Turret" may arise, and players on that Turret may acquire high bounties. In these times, a staff member may announce a Hunt That Turret event where players who succeed in killing the Turret driver, or high-bounty players on the Turret, get rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Hyperspace staff</i></p>
        <p><b>Hyperball</b>: Two teams of participants compete to score goals with a ball in a specially designed circular base in the Hyperball arena. The winning team gets rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Hi-5, Sharpflame</i></p>
        <p><b>Name That Player</b>: This is a variant of the General Trivia event where characteristic words or phrases are given by a staff member via arena messages. For each word or phrase, the first player to correctly name the player described by the word or phrase given gets rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Aceflyer, Sass, Sharpflame</i></p>
        <p><b>Paint</b>: For those with an artistic flair, Hyperspace Paint combines Continuum with art. In the specially designed Paint arena, ships are set so they have effectively 'infinite recharge', and can lay a huge amount of mines. A typical Paint event begins with one player being selected to be the 'artist', who then flies his/her ship around a rectangular box in the Paint arena, laying mines to draw an image. Each mine shows up on the radar screen of any players present, and the challenge is then presented for observing players to successfully guess what image the 'artist' drew. The first observing player to successfully guess the image gets rewarded with Hyperspace money, and also gets to be the next 'artist' to draw, at which point the previous process repeats until the event ends.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Hyperspace staff</i></p>
        <p><b>Pub Day (Night)</b>: When the number of players in the zone grows large, and everyone is on either freq 0 or freq 1 (both of which are pub freqs), a staff member may decide to host Pub Day (or Pub Night, depending on the time of day - or night!). A typical Pub Day (Night) event involves the jackpot being boosted periodically to stimulate intense basing and flagging. Freqs may also be prized various powerups such as Super or Shields at various times if deemed appropriate. Pub Day jackpots often break the one million money mark.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Hyperspace staff</i></p>
        <p><b>QuickReply Mathematics</b>: The QuickReply Mathematics event involves a staff member arena messaging a simple mathematical problem (such as 8 + 7 = ?). The first player to reply in public chat with the correct answer gets rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Aceflyer, Sharpflame</i></p>
        <p><b>Rabbit</b>: Also known as Bounty Rabbit. A typical Rabbit event begins with one player being selected to be the 'rabbit'. That player is prized with a high bounty and some powerups (such as Super and Shields), and then flies around killing other players (and making alot of money per kill due to the prized bounty). Other players in the zone try to kill the 'rabbit'. The first player to kill the 'rabbit' gets to be the next 'rabbit', at which point the previous process repeats until the event ends.</p>
        <p><i>hosted by: Hyperspace staff</i></p>
        <p><b>Racing</b>: The classic Continuum Racing event, but with a Hyperspace flair! In the specially designed Racing arena, all participants have the exact same ship (a Warbird) and do not have any weapons or powerups, save for one Rocket. Before each Racing event, participating players type ?race to be automatically taken out of spec and placed in a Warbird in the starting safe area, locked in by a forcefield. When the event is about to start, a countdown will be announced via arena messages. When "GO" is announced via an arena message, the forcefield vanishes and the race begins! Players race one lap around a closed, roughly rectangular race track, sections of which are curved around wormholes like the wormholes in the hypertunnels. The fastest players to complete one lap around the racing track get rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>

        <p><b>Tetris</b>: A variety of competitive inter-player special events are hosted in the specially designed Tetris arena. Event winners get rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>

        <p><b>Xmasmaze</b>: A holiday-themed event where participants work their way through an Xmas tree-shaped maze. The fastest players to complete the maze get rewarded with Hyperspace money.</p>
