      <div class="tut">
        <ul>
          <li>You can cloak and/or stealth Warbirds and Javelins even though you cannot buy Active Camo on either ship. The way you do it is by buying a Supercomputer.</li>
          <li>You can have a Spider or a Leviathan with rockets even though you cannot buy Getaway Packs or Tunnel Runner on either ship. The way you do it is by buying an Ultra Rocket.</li>
          <li>Extra Utility uses up a Converter spot and a Sensor spot, but in return gives you two extra Utility spots (giving you a total of 5 Utility spots).</li>
          <li>Likewise, Sensor Pod uses up a Converter spot and a Utility spot, but in return gives you two extra Sensor spots (giving you a total of 4 Sensor spots).</li>
          <li>If you stay in too long, warp out, warp in (via ?summon'ing or by F7-attaching), or otherwise 'misbehave' in the ID tunnel, your ship will be destroyed by engine failure.</li>
          <li>Gravity Trap does not block ?tw.</li>
          <li>You cannot ?tw from the hypertunnels.</li>
          <li>You cannot ?jump, ?tw, or ?id from inside the bases in Sectors 1 - 7.</li>
          <li>You can ?tw or ?jump while carrying flags.</li>
          <li>You can ?tw near walls and even in safes.</li>
          <li>If you're in a Lancaster, using ?tw or ?id will kill any turrets that happen to be attached to you.</li>
          <li>Each (additional) turret (yes, Point Defense counts as a turret) you get on your Lancaster decreases your speed (unless you have Turret Base, which cancels this effect out).</li>
          <li>Each time you use ?tw, your bounty will be reset (to 10).</li>
          <li>Cobalt Warheads and Thors can go through any normal walls; however, they are blocked (as in absorbed) by special 'thor-proof' 'double' walls. These walls partially enclose the flagrooms of the bases in Sectors 2, 3, 5, and 6, and make up the lower and right boundaries of the minibase in the center area.</li>
          <li>Using repellers while in an enemy field will not protect you from the bullets shot at you by said enemy field.</li>
          <li>According to ?iteminfo Close Combat, two Close Combats will give you 4 repels per life; however, the maximum number of repels any ship (except Lancaster) can have per life is 3, so that's how many repels you'll have per life if you get two Close Combats on any given ship (except for Lancaster, in which case you'll have 4 repels per life).</li>
          <li>Turret Base gives you an awesome centering Lancaster, but beware of bursts: Turret Base increases burst damage to your ship, to the point that if you take even one burst, you'll be dead or very nearly dead. Even if you were at full energy.</li>
          <li>According to ?iteminfo Turret Base, Turret Base will give you 10 rockets per life; however, the maximum number of rockets a Lancaster can have per life is 7, so that's how many rockets you'll have per life if you get Turret Base on a Lancaster.</li>
          <li>You can ?sell Point Defense for what it costs to ?buy Point Defense, so you can effectively try it out risk-free.</li>
          <li>Any kills Point Defense makes count as its kills, not as your kills.</li>
          <li>The Point Defense turret cannot be killed, which is why it is programmed so it cannot accumulate bounty.</li>
          <li>Even though the Point Defense turret uses L4 guns, your bombs (if they have shrapnel) will only have L1 shrapnel.</li>
          <li>You cannot ?id or be ?summon'ed while carrying flags.</li>
          <li>Slipstream increases your speed and maneuverability; however, it increases bullet and bomb damage to your ship.</li>
          <li>VERTEX Armor is powerful armor; however, it increases the length of time your energy is frozen after you are EMP'd - hence, you actually become more sensitive/vulnerable to EMP bombs.</li>
          <li>Disruptor and Shredder do almost exactly the same amount of damage per second (to the target) and drain almost exactly the same amount of energy per second (from the user).</li>
          <li>However, since more people have "low energy gun armor" than "high energy gun armor," and since Disruptor also gives your bombs L3 shrapnel (whereas Shredder only gives your bombs L1 shrapnel), Disruptor is still a better gun than Shredder.</li>
          <li>Plasma Cannon is, basically, an enhanced Shrap Booster. So there's no reason to get Shrap Booster on any ship you can get Plasma Cannon on.</li>
          <li>The Sector 4-Sector 8 'transwarp' link allows flag-carrying ships to transit safely.</li>
          <li>Flags dropped or neuted in the hypertunnels are randomly relocated throughout the center area. Hence, you cannot win a flag game by dropping flags in the hypertunnels.</li>
