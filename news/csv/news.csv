5,1438948801,Ceiu,"<p>Got some new items and tweaked some others.</p><p>First up is the change to thorstorm and the (re-)addition of the item capacitors. Thorstorm, Repel Capacitor and Burst Capacitor now provide capacity for thors, repels and bursts respectively, but the ammunition for them must be gathered from greens. The trade-off is you can store several times more of an item and can unload them all at once, but you have to spend the time to collect enough greens to fill them back up.</p><p>Secondly, Energy Scanner is now an alien tech as well as a sensor. This easy-mode item will now compete with the top-tier superitems and Antideath. Additionally, Oracle's energy scanning is now only level 1, officially making Sensor Disruptor a hard-counter to any energy scanning. Those of you who had Energy Scanner will need to sell it and re-purchase it if desired.</p><p>-C</p>"

8,1442059200,Ceiu,"<p>By popular demand, Antideath has been removed entirely. Those of you who had Antideath will need to be refunded. While we usually do a refund item, I screwed that part up and ended up just deleting the existing AD entirely. So, if you had AD, contact me in-game and I'll refund you directly.</p><p>Also, other item changes have gone in today:</p><p><ul><li>Fire delay on Phoenix Missile has been increased to 1.5s</li><li>Casing on Overthruster has been corrected.</li></ul></p><p>Sometime this weekend, the new time-based flag rewards will be going in. There's a bunch of details involved there, but the jist of it is that flag rewards now are scaled based on how long you've been in the game for that team. If you play like you're supposed to play, you shouldn't notice any difference. However, if you're a player that has regularly hopped (despite several of us telling you not to), you'll notice your rewards will be significantly smaller.</p><p>-C</p>"
