      <h1>Rules and Guidelines</h1>
      <p>Hyperspace does not have a explicit list of rules, however the following is provided as a guide to better align players with the governing vision of the Hyperspace staff.</p>
      <div class="tut">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Use common sense. If you think it might be wrong, it probably is. Hyperspace staff reserve the right to spontaneously declare new rules to address whatever stupid thing you might be trying to do.</b></li>
          <li><b>Do not use abusive, harassing, racist or offensive language.</b> Subspace is a game; it is meant to provide entertainment, and, most importantly, to be fun. Do not use the chat in any way that would discriminate your fellow players. Profanity is allowed in conversation, but attempting to circumvent the obscenity filter with alternate spellings, abbreviations, or otherwise is not tolerated.</li>
          <li><b>Cheating, or exploiting glitches is not allowed.</b> Period.</li>
          <li><b>Do not spam, flood, or advertise in chat.</b> Don't be annoying. A staff member may issue a warning, but if they find you offensive enough, you may get silenced for any amount of time, or outright banned.</li>
          <li><b>Tradekilling, and farming are not allowed.</b> Make money the honest way, by playing.</li>
